## Introduction

py-obs is a Python package that wraps the OBS WebSocket API functionality in order to provide easy programmatic access to OBS resources using Python. This package is designed to abstract as much configuration away so content creators can quickly and easily write scripts to automate tasks in OBS studio. Having dabbled in streaming myself, I was looking for a package like this with very clear documentation; this package was designed with my own experiences and desires in mind. This package will be open to contributions soon.
